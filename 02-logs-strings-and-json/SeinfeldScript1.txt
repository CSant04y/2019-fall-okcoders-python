[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry and George are waiting for Kramer, so he can help them move George's stuff back into his parent's house)

GEORGE: I can't believe this!

JERRY: Oh, it won't be for that long.

GEORGE: How can I do this?! How can I move back in with those {noun1}? Please, tell me! They're insane! You know that.

JERRY: Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.

GEORGE: How can you compare you parents to my parents?!

JERRY: My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!

GEORGE: My father wears his {clothing1} in the pool! {clothing1}!

JERRY: My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.

GEORGE: (Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'

JERRY: A smirk?

GEORGE: Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!

JERRY: I told you I'd lend you the {noun2} for the rent.

GEORGE: No, no, no, no. Borrowing {noun2} from a friend is like {verb1}. It just completely changes the relationship.

(Kramer stumbles in)

KRAMER: Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?

GEORGE: I don't want to! I'm outta {noun2}! I got {number1} {noun2} left in the bank.

KRAMER: Well, move in here.

JERRY: (Stopping the notion) What's that?

KRAMER: Why doesn't he just move in here?

GEORGE: (Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!

KRAMER: You can move in with me, if you want.

GEORGE: (Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.

(Scene ends)
