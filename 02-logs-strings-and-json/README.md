# Logs, Strings, and JSON

## Week 2 objective
1. Make an account with PythonAnywhere
1. Saving python code in files
1. importing libraries
1. Reading and writing files
1. String parsing and formatting
1. Getting input from the terminal
1. Write a Mad Gabs program
1. Use a linter like pep8/flake8

## PythonAnywhere
There are probably over 100 sites that offer free or cheap hosting and editing of Python code.
Some are better than others, and I have found this one to be particularly easy to use.

## Saving code in files
Python takes all of the basic program configuration and assumes default values, so there isn't any boilerplate required for small projects.
The general guidelines are to start with imports before classes, functions, and inline code.
Meaningful whitespace starts to make more sense when you organize code into files.

## Importing Libraries
Libraries have to be downloaded and "installed" before they can be imported.
The same syntax we use for libraries will also work for importing our own code.

## Reading and writing files
open(), read*(), write*()

## String Parsing
split(), join()

## String Formatting
f'', ''.format()

## Getting Input
input()

## Practical: Mad Gabs
I hope everyone is familiar with Mad Gabs/Mad Libs.
I recommend starting with text from your favorite poem, book, song, or movie.
Identify some {noun}, {verb}, {adjective}, {adverb}, etc.
Gather user input and output the results.

## Use Flake8 to see recommended style changes to your code
probably requires flake8 installation
